# BONUS TASK! Cyber Security - Post Incident Review

### Prepare an executive summary and outline opportunities for improvement

Here is the background information on your task
Computer security incident response has become an important component of a business’s IT program. Security-related threats have become not only more numerous and diverse but also more damaging and disruptive. An incident response capability is necessary for rapidly detecting incidents, minimising loss and destruction, mitigating the weaknesses that were exploited and restoring computing services. 

As part of the post-incident response to the client, we require a report that details an executive summary as well as recommendations for the client based on a cybersecurity resilience framework. Resilience framework and recommendations will allow the client to identify and manage the privacy of the informational assets of the business.

Good luck with the task and remember to always be curious. Look through the information provided on this page and anything else that might warrant your attention.Here is your task
Following on from our incident analysis, we will provide a report in MS Word format that will give the client an executive overview of what has occurred, as well as possible recommendations and opportunities to improve.

The following information should be noted:

The client currently has little to no cyber security measures in place to prevent a cyber-attack both at the host and network level, ie. IPS/IDS or Spam Filters.
The client has allocated no resources currently to develop a cyber-mitigation and strategy plan.
The client has a number of third party service providers who also have no cyber security strategies or implementations.
The client has little to none authentication / authorization controls.
Recommendations to consider include:
3rd party risk
Safety and employee awareness
Cyber hygiene
Incident response improvements
Monitoring and information management
The recommendations should align with our current cyber resilience framework which is based on the NIST Model, and how these recommendations can assist the client in meeting the standards set out by NIST.

The structure of the report should be a half page executive summary, followed by the recommendations, observations and opportunities to improve. This should equate to no more than three pages in total.
